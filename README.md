# Provigos - Azure Function App

Provigos is an open-source project aimed at creating a **personal life dashboard** that empowers users to manage and analyze their data from multiple services. With a focus on **data privacy**, **user control**, and integration with **Quantified Self** practices, Provigos leverages Azure Function Apps to handle serverless data processing and integrations efficiently.

## Overview

Provigos provides users with tools to:
- Aggregate data from various personal services (e.g., health trackers, calendars, financial tools).
- Process and analyze this data securely.
- Visualize insights through a unified life dashboard.

This repository contains the **Azure Function App** implementation for Provigos, designed to handle the backend logic and integrations.

---

## Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Processes data in real-time using Azure Functions' serverless capabilities.
- **Data Privacy by Design**: Ensures that user data is processed and stored securely with minimal exposure.
- **Modular Integrations**: Easily connect and extend support for new services and data sources.
- **Custom Analytics**: Transform raw data into meaningful metrics for Quantified Self analysis.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for easy addition of new triggers, bindings, and processing workflows.

## Architecture

Provigos' Azure Function App is part of a broader system architecture that includes:

1. **Data Aggregation Layer**  
   Azure Functions integrate with third-party APIs using HTTP triggers and timers to fetch data periodically.  

2. **Processing and Transformation**  
   Data is processed, normalized, and stored using Azure Storage or external databases (e.g., Cosmos DB).  

3. **Visualization and Dashboard**  
   The processed data is sent to the front-end application for user-friendly visualization.
